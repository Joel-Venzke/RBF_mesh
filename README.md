# RBF_mesh
This is a code to solve the Time Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation with radial basis functions. The code utilize polyharmonic splines and attached exponentials. 

The mesh.py file will solve for the Hydrogen atom's bound states using the RBF implimentation in Node_Set.py. The MD_node_sets are from https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~rsw/Sphere/ and are used for resolving the angular portion of the wavefunction
